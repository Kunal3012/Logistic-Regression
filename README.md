# Logistic Regression: Mathematical Implementation Documentation

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. It's a predictive analysis algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome based on input features. Despite its name, it's used for classification rather than regression.

## Mathematical Background

### Hypothesis Function

In logistic regression, the hypothesis function is the logistic function (sigmoid function):

\[ h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^Tx}} \]

- \( h_\theta(x) \) is the predicted probability that \( y = 1 \) given \( x \) and parameterized by \( \theta \).
- \( x \) represents the input features.
- \( \theta \) is the vector of coefficients (weights).

### Decision Boundary

The decision boundary separates different classes based on the predicted probability. It's where the hypothesis function equals 0.5.

### Cost Function (Log Loss)

The cost function for logistic regression is the logarithmic loss (or cross-entropy loss):

\[ J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log(h_\theta(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \right] \]

- \( J(\theta) \) computes the error between predicted and actual values.
- \( m \) is the number of samples.
- \( y^{(i)} \) is the actual label for the \( i \)th sample.
- \( x^{(i)} \) is the input features for the \( i \)th sample.
- \( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) \) is the predicted probability for the \( i \)th sample.

### Optimization (Gradient Descent)

The goal is to minimize the cost function \( J(\theta) \) by updating \( \theta \) iteratively using gradient descent:

\[ \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta) \]

- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
- \( \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta) \) computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to \( \theta_j \).

## Implementation

### Steps for Implementation

1. **Initialization:** Initialize parameters \( \theta \) with zeros or random values.
2. **Compute Hypothesis:** Calculate \( h_\theta(x) \) using the logistic function.
3. **Compute Cost:** Calculate the cost function \( J(\theta) \) using the log loss formula.
4. **Gradient Descent:** Update parameters \( \theta \) using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
5. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict classes for new data.

### Example Code (Python)

```python
import numpy as np

# Sigmoid (logistic) function
def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

# Initialize parameters
theta = np.zeros(X.shape[1])

# Compute hypothesis
hypothesis = sigmoid(np.dot(X, theta))

# Compute cost function (log loss)
cost = -1/m * np.sum(y * np.log(hypothesis) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - hypothesis))

# Gradient Descent (update theta)
theta -= alpha * (1/m) * np.dot(X.T, (hypothesis - y))
```

## Conclusion

Logistic Regression is a fundamental algorithm for binary classification tasks. Understanding its mathematical underpinnings and implementing it allows for a better grasp of its functionality and customization.

## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction Project utilizes logistic regression to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on input features such as passenger class, gender, age, and more. The model is trained on historical data and can make survival predictions for new passenger details provided.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains passenger information such as name, age, gender, ticket class, survival status, etc.

## Requirements

To run the project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis and model training)

Install required packages via:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```

3. Run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict_survival.py
```

Follow the prompts to input passenger details and get the survival prediction.

## Features

The following features are considered for prediction:

- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Gender (Sex)
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses (SibSp)
- Number of Parents/Children (Parch)
- Fare

## Model Training

The logistic regression model is trained on the Titanic dataset using Python's scikit-learn library. The data is preprocessed, missing values handled, and categorical variables encoded for training.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set, indicating its ability to predict survival outcomes based on the given features.
