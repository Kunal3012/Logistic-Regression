# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict survival outcomes for passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The model is trained on the historic Titanic dataset, considering various factors such as passenger class, gender, age, family relations onboard, and fare paid.

## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction Project utilizes logistic regression to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on input features such as passenger class, gender, age, and more. The model is trained on historical data and can make survival predictions for new passenger details provided.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It contains passenger information such as name, age, gender, ticket class, survival status, etc.

## Requirements

To run the project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis and model training)

Install required packages via:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```

3. Run the prediction script:

```bash
python predict_survival.py
```

Follow the prompts to input passenger details and get the survival prediction.

## Features

The following features are considered for prediction:

- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Gender (Sex)
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses (SibSp)
- Number of Parents/Children (Parch)
- Fare

## Model Training

The logistic regression model is trained on the Titanic dataset using Python's scikit-learn library. The data is preprocessed, missing values handled, and categorical variables encoded for training.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set, indicating its ability to predict survival outcomes based on the given features.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the project are welcome! Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.
